.. _dci:relatedIdentifier:

Related Identifier (MA, 0-n)
==========================

``datacite:relatedIdentifier``

Identifiers of related resources other than the resource being registered. OpenAIRE especially encourages relating datasets with publications and software, but appreciatively welcomes other kinds of relations too.

**Allowed values, other constraints**

A relatedIdentifier must be globally unique and should be durable. Preferrably it is registered with an established identification system, or is a permalink or stable URL.

The format is free text - a unique string that unambiguously identifies a resource within its given context and follows the respective specifications.
