.. _dci:version:

Resource Version (R, 1)
==========================

``datacite:version``

The version can indicate two things:

* The version number of a dataset or software.
* The status in the publication process.

**Allowed values, other constraints**

For version numbers any string will be accepted, but a semantically-versioned tag is recommended. See <https://semver.org> for more information on semantic versioning.
