What's new
==========

For the data guidelines version **3.0** at hand the major change is the harmonisation with the latest DataCite schema version 4.3 ( `10.14454/f2wp-s162 <https://doi.org/10.14454/f2wp-s162>`_ ).

This version updates the vocabulary for some elements in the application profile.

- The rights element has updated its vocabulary to `COAR Access Rights Vocabulary <http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/>`_
- Following DataCite, funding statements are moved from contributor to the dedicated field fundingReference.
